# Preface {-}
 
Hello! Welcome to our final project of Network Science! This bookdown is a work in progress, and please check back early and often (as much as people do to their Github code). Feel free to contact us if you have any questions!

&nbsp;

> Now that we are in the realm of networks, we feel compelled to motivate our project with an xkcd comic related to networks.
